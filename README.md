# Introduction to Machine Learning (TDT4172) â€” Assignments

This repository contains course assignments and example solutions for the TDT4172 (Introduction to Machine Learning) practicals. The work is organized as a set of missions (notebooks, datasets, and simple model implementations) used to learn fundamentals of machine learning: linear & logistic regression, decision trees, ensembling and model validation.

Quick start
1. Create and activate a Python environment, then install dependencies:
```pip install requirements.txt```
2. Open a notebook
